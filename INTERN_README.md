# So you want to learn more about the professional world of software engineering
Welcome to the team for your internship!  Although this engagement isn't permanent, let's take this opportunity to set a few expectations.  Many of the tenants from my [Manager README for full-time direct reports](https://github.com/esquireofoz/Manager-README/blob/master/README.md) apply, but the nature and duration of an internship have some additional nuances we'll cover here.

---
## What I expect of you:
* In the first week of your internship we will create a set of goals which will help determine how we spend our time as well as what we focus on.

* Also within your first week we will land on a project and you will start putting together a project plan mapping out specific milestones and the route to achieve them.

* You will not be required to participate in anything related to on-call (unless you wish to learn about it).

* There is a lot of information which will be disseminated in a short period of time - **please ask questions**.  We are here to support you!

* I ask you keep notes about both things that went well as well as pain points with the internship.  We are always looking to improve, and this feedback is super helpful.

## What you can expect of me:
* You will receive an onboarding document which will cover administrivia as well as an overview of the tools and technologies directly relevant to your internship.

* You will be added to the team's communication channels (e.g., slack), code review processes, email distribution lists and all team meetings (e.g., sprint planning, standup, project meetings, fun stuff, etc.) for the duration of your internship.

* You will be paired with a technical mentor from the team who help with your project and work to ensure your success.

* You will have regularly scheduled weekly 1:1s with me.

## General Advice
* Get to know your fellow interns -- the diversity of backgrounds and experience with the different teams they are interning on is very valuable.  The more you can learn from your peers, the better!

* Get outside of your comfort zone and don't be afraid to make mistakes. You won't be put in a position where mistakes will do major damage (until you are ready). Internships are great opportunities to explore different options -- you should be experimenting and pushing yourself!

* Remember, **ask a lot of questions**!! You are not expected to know everything right away. If you're struggling with something, chances are someone else has struggled with it before and will be happy to help out.

* Take advantage of the time in your host city for the internship.  Resources like [Time Out](https://www.timeout.com/) and [Wikitravel](https://wikitravel.org/en/Main_Page) are great resources for getting ideas about things to do.

## What's next:
* That's it - I appreciate this opportunity for us to work together, and I hope we learn a lot from the experience and have fun!
