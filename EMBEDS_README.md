# Let's get to know each other a little better
Welcome (temporarily) to the team!  Although this engagement isn't permanent, let's take this opportunity to set a few expectations.  Many of the tenants from my [Manager README for full-time direct reports](https://github.com/esquireofoz/Manager-README/blob/master/README.md) apply, but the nature of an embedding arrangement has some additional nuances we'll cover here.

---
## What I expect of you:
* Before you spend any time with the team, you will receive an embedding template where we will set goals, timeline and the scope of the engagement.

* You will not be required to participate in anything related to on-call (unless you wish to learn about it).

* Prior to the embedding we will create a set of shared goals which will encompass both the subject matter you wish to explore during the engagement as well as the time commitment.

* I ask you keep notes about both things that went well as well as pain points with the embedding which will be shared once the engagement has completed.  We are always looking to improve, and this feedback is super helpful.

## What you can expect of me:
* You will receive an onboarding document with detailed information about team process as well as the technical material which your embedding will focus on.

* You will be added to the team's private communication channel (e.g., slack), code review processes (e.g., github teams), email distribution lists and all team meetings (e.g., sprint planning, standup, project meetings, fun stuff, etc.) for the duration of your embedding.

* You will have regularly scheduled weekly 1:1s with me.


## What's next:
* That's it - I appreciate this opportunity for us to work together, and I hope we learn a lot from the experience and have fun!
